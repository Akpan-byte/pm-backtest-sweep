# CHANGE_SUMMARY
# 2026-07-10  kilo
#   - Created daily_orb_v5 signal.
#   - Anchors opening range to 9:30 AM ET (US equity market open) and keeps it
#     fixed for the entire trading day, matching the YM ORB v5 backtest anchor.
#   - Supports per-timeframe OR windows (1m, 3m, 5m, 15m, 30m, 1h) plus an "any"
#     mode that trades the first breakout from any timeframe.
#   - Re-entry logic requires spot to pull back inside the daily OR range before
#     re-breaking in the same direction.
# 2026-07-10  kilo (audit fixes)
#   - Fixed OR window boundary: now 09:30:00 inclusive through 09:30+or_seconds
#     exclusive (was including one extra second).
#   - Fixed "any" mode re-entry pullback zone to use the timeframe that actually
#     triggered the last entry, instead of hard-coding the 5m range.
#   - Added _prune_state to drop daily state older than 2 days and prevent
#     unbounded memory growth.
# 2026-07-10  kilo (restart resilience)
#   - Persist per-(asset,date,tf_mode,max_reentries) state to disk so a restart
#     restores entry/re-entry counts, cooldown, last_trigger_tf and the finalized
#     opening range instead of starting fresh.
#   - Added warm_start(): on runner startup, reload persisted state; if the OR is
#     missing or not finalized and we are past 9:30 ET, backfill the range from
#     the Hyperliquid tick archive (live CSV + zstd-rotated files) over the exact
#     window [09:30:00, 09:30+or_sec). Because the OR is a pure function of that
#     price window, backfill reproduces the same range a continuous run would
#     have produced.
#   - Entries that fired while the process was down are NOT backfilled/fabricated
#     (a restart is a real operational event and the paper log must reflect it);
#     only the OR and the last-flushed re-entry state are recovered.
# WHY: User wants the ProjectX-style daily ORB ported to Polymarket UP/DOWN
#      markets for BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB, XRP, and HYPE, and a restart must leave
#      the strategy trading exactly as if it had been alive since the 9:30 open.

"""
Daily Opening Range Breakout v5 for Polymarket UP/DOWN markets.

This signal mirrors the YM ORB v5 logic from the ProjectX live bot:
  * The opening range is anchored to 9:30 AM ET and stays fixed all day.
  * Each timeframe has its own OR window length and breakout buffer.
  * Long breakout  -> buy YES on the active contract.
  * Short breakout -> buy NO  on the active contract.

State is keyed by (asset, date, tf_mode, max_reentries) so each asset and
variant has an independent daily state. State is persisted to disk and the
opening range is recoverable from the Hyperliquid tick archive so a process
restart does not reset the day.
