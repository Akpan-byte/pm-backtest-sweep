# CHANGE_SUMMARY
# 2026-07-16  kilo
#   - Phase 1 VWAP retuning: added per-trade exit rules (TP, SL, trailing stop,
#     max-hold, min-rem, VWAP reversion) via Portfolio._eval_exit_rules().
#   - Trade now stores exit_rules and trail_best; both survive to_dict/from_dict.
#   - check_exits() accepts optional indicators dict with vwap/price/elapsed_sec.
#   - scale_in() resets trail_best to the new blended entry price.
# 2026-07-02  kilo
#   - Created engine/portfolio.py to track active trades and handle exits.
#   - Entry respects max price, reentry limits, and capital. Exits snipe at 0.99 or resolve at expiry.
# 2026-07-02  kilo
#   - perf_dict() now includes name, total_trades (active + closed), and open_positions.
# 2026-07-02  runner-diagnostics-fix
#   - Hardened check_exits() against None prices/rem_sec so a transient Redis miss
#     does not crash the market loop.
# 2026-07-03  kilo
#   - Added entry_spot to Trade so expiry resolution works for up/down-over-window
#     markets that have no fixed strike.
#   - check_entry now accepts entry_spot from the runner and stores it on the trade.
#   - check_exits resolves YES/NO against entry_spot when available, falling back to strike.
#   - Added Portfolio.force_exit() for closing positions whose markets dropped from discovery.
# 2026-07-03  kilo
#   - Dropped EXIT_SNIPE_PRICE from 0.99 to 0.97 for both YES and NO exits.
#   - check_entry now accepts latency_book, fair_price, and queue_fraction.
#   - Added synthetic-book, EV slippage, and latency guards to check_entry.
# 2026-07-03  kilo
#   - check_entry now uses max_notional as the spendable cap when rounding up to
#     min_contracts and scaling down oversized fills. This prevents a runner from
#     spending more from the global pool than it reserved.
# 2026-07-05  kilo
#   - Expiry resolution now prefers the market-open/start-of-window oracle price
#     (market["open_oracle_price"]) and uses a Chainlink oracle spot when supplied.
#   - Entry/exit fees now use the market's feeSchedule when present, matching
#     Polymarket's crypto fee formula: shares * rate * price * (1 - price).
#   - Added Trade.exit_fee and applied exit taker fees to proceeds and PnL.
# 2026-07-05  kilo
#   - Added MIN_ENTRY_PRICE = 0.05 guard so the bot never enters positions at
#     prices that imply an already-resolved market (e.g., 0.001 lottery tickets).
# 2026-07-05  kilo
#   - Phase 1 accounting fixes:
#     * PnL now subtracts both entry_fee and exit_fee.
#     * Added ``_cash_derived`` flag and ``cash_adjustment_log`` for ledger repairs.
#     * ``state_dict`` recomputes cash from the ledger when ``_cash_derived`` is True.
#     * ``load_state`` enforces the invariant ``cash == initial_capital + total_pnl - committed``
#       and repairs the ledger when the stored cash diverges by more than $0.05.
#     * Documented that ``equity()`` marks active positions at entry price unless
#       ``mark_prices`` is supplied.
# WHY: Phase 1 accounting fix. Cash must stay consistent with realized PnL and
#      committed capital. The previous PnL formula ignored the entry fee and state
#      files were allowed to drift from the ledger invariant.
